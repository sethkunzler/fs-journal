# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern
01. What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
  
  > Inheritance (sharing of information)
  Encapsulation (grouping of information)
  Abstraction (hiding of information)
  Polymorphism (redefining of information)

  having exported classes that can be used throughout your application that call on hidden functions that cannot be Universally accessed throughout the app to redefine an array of data accessed from elsewhere in the app is an example of all four pillars supporting the object oriented programming.


02. How does `export` differ from `export default`?
  
  > syntax for importing and applying it in the file you are importing it to.

03. What is Encapsulation?
  
  > The bundling of data and the methods that act on that data such that access to that data is restricted from outside the bundle. This means that an object stores its state privately, and only the objectâ€™s methods have access to change it.

04. What are some of the benefits of the `Proxy` object that we are using in our structure for applications?
  
  > by using proxies we can limit what information or which properties are called from one file to another.

05. What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
  
  > an instance of class can only access the function instructions of it's methods and does not give access to the method itself which can prevent overwriting what the method does. 

06. What is a computed Property?
  
  > a property is a data type that is stored on an object and the computed property is the data type that is evaluated and retrieved with it's accompanying value

07. What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
  
  > to organize data under the SOLID principle

08. What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
  
  > The Controllers's Job is to track events in the view and draw data to the DOM (i.e. I saw someone click the button, so I am going to tell the service, and then I am going to wait for the service to tell me how I should redraw this part of the webpage.)

09. What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
  
  > The services job is to be out of the way where the user can't access it. It relies on the controller to give it all of the information it needs to know about when to change data, and the AppState to know what the data originally looked like. it then changes that data based on specific methods that were called and reports it back to the controller

10. What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
  
  > to tell the AppState how data is supposed to look on the Webpage. it supplies objects with a template for drawing data into a new object, and how the information drawn to the dom should look after the object is built.
