# Working in a Professional Environment
01. What is Inheritance?

> Inheritance is when one property is passed down from one placed to another

02. What is the `Singleton` design pattern?

> The singleton design pattern restricts logic to the service systems which can only only be accessed in a singular manner. It helps to increase application security and decluter code.

03. What is the `Observer` design pattern?

> When one place holds all the App Data, and every other part of the App references that information observing for changes and updates to react dynamically through out the app.

04. What is the `Strategy` design pattern?

>  Extracitng logic out to components so that one or another component of logic can be selected reactively. One example might be deciding to have button display different things depending on the state of the user's character being at FullHealth, Damaged, or Dead. where the same function gets called but runs seperate logic based on the health percentage of the character. The button changes from summoning a creature to opening a portal, to reviving you. 

05. What is the `Factory` design pattern?

> It is a creational design pattern, or a pattern used to create objects for more flexibility and reuse. Using the Factory pattern, you can create objects without having to specify what type of object they are on instance

06. What is test driven development?

> A methodology where you create the test before writing the actual code that will pass the test. this way you at least always know where you are at in your code.

07. In Scrum/Agile what is the DoD?

> Definition of Done - the collective, or top-down decided state of being done in any one particular task. 

08. Give two examples of a user story:

> A general explanation of the end experience of the user. How using the application does or should feel to a user. The User Experience

09. During which ceremony is your Sprint Backlog created?

> As a relative todo list, it is typically created in the first sprint planning and added to during or before following sprint planning sessions as more product from the product backlog becomes available or as the product owner sees fit to add them (Antwon in the movie 'Free Guy' - "Alright Nerds, put him on the screen. I want to see him, and I want to see him now. Yes! There He IS! I want him in the new update, give him muscles and a six pack. He's going to make me loads of money"). In sprint planning, Items from the Sprint backlog are clearly ordered so that everyone knows which should be done next and what should be completed before the end of the sprint

10. In which of these ceremonies are Tasks assigned to you?

> Tasks are also assigned to you in the Sprint Planning. By the end of it you should have a pretty good idea of the end goal and what you need to do or start doing to help the team get there.
