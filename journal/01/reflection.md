# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I gained a firm grasp on how objects line up on a page and I am now really confident in my abilities after some basic bootstraping
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
I was suprised by a ton of vs and bs and css shorcuts and quick methods that I had never seen before and I am really excited to use frequently
- What are you struggling with?
I am strugling with living in a new town, with the bus routes, with porting my number over, and with filing my taxes, but we are getting there... by busðŸ˜‚
- What would you count as a victory?
I would count me only having to deal with code everyday as an absolute win! I hope I can say that it's all I'll have to deal with by the end of next week. 
This course is so much fun, even when it's not easy at first.
