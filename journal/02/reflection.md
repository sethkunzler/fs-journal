# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
  > I liked being able to work with the window alerts and prompts
- What are you struggling with?
  > I feel like I am still struggling with some of the methods and applying them .forEach() and .filter(), I have also been having unexpected problems with my conditionals and the way that I write those out. 
- What would you count as a victory?
 >passing my checkpoint this week on the first try without needing turn around and taking it anyways would be a huge victory for me.
