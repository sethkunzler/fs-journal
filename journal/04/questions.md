# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > Synchronous code is when all the code runs in tandem, functions firing off as soon as the one before them is called.
  <br> Asynchronous code is when the code waits for specific parts to be completed before calling on the following function

02. What is an event listener?

  > when an event is emitted, its like a broadcast that is sent out through out the entire application saying that something important and specific just happened, listeners wait until they receive a specific broadcast and then they preform a specified function. 

03. What does *REST* stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean??

06. Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?

  > AJAX(Async), XMLHttpRequest, and Callbacks. examples of requests are fetch() and CRUD

07. What does the `API` acronym stand for?

  >Application Programming Interface

08. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

  > async the function. 

09. What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?

  > It allows you to be more flexible with the structure of your data.

10. What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?

  > 200

11. What is a 400 error?

  > Bad request
